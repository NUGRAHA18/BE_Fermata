 * Broker connection and topic configuration.

 * template configured here and nowhere else - no topic string is written in Java code. When the
 * hardware team settles the convention, this file changes and nothing else does.
 *
 * <p>Credentials come from the environment and are never logged or exposed through the API.
 *
 * @param enabled when false no broker connection is attempted and the in-memory loopback transport
 *     is used instead, which is what lets the backend run with no hardware and no broker present
 * @param topics templates per {@link TopicKind}; {@code {deviceId}} is substituted with a device code
